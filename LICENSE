This software is partly build on pamscale; the copyright notice of which follows below:


/* pamscale.c - rescale (resample) a PNM image

   This program evolved out of Jef Poskanzer's program Pnmscale from
   his Pbmplus package (which was derived from Poskanzer's 1989
   Ppmscale).  The resampling logic was taken from Michael Reinelt's
   program Pnmresample, somewhat recoded to follow Netpbm conventions.
   Michael submitted that for inclusion in Netpbm in December 2003.
   The frame of the program is by Bryan Henderson, and the old scaling
   algorithm is based on that in Jef Poskanzer's Pnmscale, but
   completely rewritten by Bryan Henderson ca. 2000.  Plenty of other
   people contributed code changes over the years.
